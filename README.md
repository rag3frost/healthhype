## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Supabase account
- OpenWeather API key (for allergy tracking)
- Groq API key (for AI features)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthhype.git
cd healthhype
```

2. **Set up the backend**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the models
python train_models.py

# Start the Flask server
python app.py
```

3. **Set up the frontend**
```bash
cd medipredict-react
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```
FATSECRET_CLIENT_ID=your_fatsecret_id
FATSECRET_CLIENT_SECRET=your_fatsecret_secret
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

1. Run the Supabase migrations in order:
```bash
supabase db reset
```

2. The migrations will create:
- User profiles
- Assessment tables for each disease type
- Document verification system
- Contact form submissions
- Nutrition tracking
